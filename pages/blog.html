				<p>
					Technology has taken over the world. It is becoming more and more advanced as time passes by. Everyday new innovations are discovered. From the invention of chopping tools two million years ago, which is known to be the first invention in the history of technology, to the world of robotics and AI, technology has come a long way.<br> 
					Technology has been a friend to us in our daily life. It has made our daily life easier and faster. Without technology, our life wouldn’t have been this easier. For example, if there were no vehicles, then how much hectic would it have been for us to travel on foot. The world would have been a dull place without technological advancements.<br>
					Our society has been more and more into technology in last two decades. It was only a decade back when cell phones were only used for calling send texts. But now, if we make a list of things that can be done with a single cellphone, the list might even be longer than the Great Wall. Advancement of technology in different sectors has made our daily life more and more convenient.<br>

			<div class="conclusion">

				<p>
					Technology has given us many things beyond the limits of our imagination. It's all thanks to technology that we are getting to live a smart life. But with all these wonderful innovations comes the downside. Yes, the benefits we get from technology are indisputable, but the damages it has caused are not negligible.<br>
					Technology can be said to be very addictive as a result of its convenience and the easy comfort sources accompanied with entertainment that it offers. It is however important that one tries to find a balance between nature and technology and not get too much of technology. If one can do this, it is sure that one’s life will change for a better and one would be able to live a life that is happy and free of stress and depression.
