The concept of keeping the color of navigation bar same as the welcome section looked pretty good. So, putting some own concepts and ideas and taking the color combination of the as top priority, the homepage was created. The homepage contains navigation bar through which whole page can be navigated thoroughly. It also contains some books displayed in sale, Topsellers and some more categories.

So, by making a few amends and putting own ideas to lighten up the page, the products page was created. The products page contains navigation bar at the top and footer containing info at the bottom. The main content of products page is the books that the bookstore sells. The books are arranged into divisions according to their genre. There is also a recommendation section where a book is displayed with its short synopsis and another section where more books of same genre are displayed.

The design of the website seemed simple yet elegant and perfect for the blog. So, referencing with the website by adding some of own ideas and making some changes, the blog page was created. The blog is about how technology has affected our daily life with the heading "Imapcts of technology in daily life". Here, the positive and negative impacts of technolgy in our daily life are explained with adding images to the blog to make it look elegant with minimalist look. The blog page has a good color combination of shades of blue.
